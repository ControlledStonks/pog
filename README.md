# pog
poggers

## usage
(If you want to run from source, you probably already know how.)

1. Get the latest executable zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/ControlledStonks/pog/releases).
2. Unzip it.
3. Run pog.exe
4. If you don't have an oauth token, or a way to get one you can use [this website](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/), but bear in mind that will give the token total control over your account rather than just the ability to send messages.
