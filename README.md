poggers

## usage
(If you want to run from source, you probably already know how.)

1. Get the latest executable zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/ControlledStonks/pog/releases).
2. Unzip it.
3. Run `pog.exe`
4. If you don't have an oauth token, you can use [this website](https://twitchtokengenerator.com/). You can just choose 'Bot Chat Token'.    
   Note: if you use a different service to get a token, you need to change the `client_id` under `login` in your `config.json`. The default one is from that website.
