## usage
1. Duplicate `config.example.json` to create `config.json`
2. Fill in your login details; if you don't have an oauth token or a way to get one you can use [this website](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/), but bear in mind that will give the token total control over your account rather than just the ability to send messages.
3. Fill in the emote you want to use. You can also add any templates you want.
4. Run main.py (you must have Python 3 installed)
